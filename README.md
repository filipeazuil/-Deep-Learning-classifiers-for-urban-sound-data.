# Deep-Learning classifiers for urban sound data

This project focuses on developing and evaluating deep learning classifiers for urban sound classification using the UrbanSound8K dataset. We implemented and compared multiple architectures, including CNNs and RNNs (e.g., Vanilla RNN, GRU, and LSTM), to classify audio excerpts into one of ten predefined categories. 

The project explores preprocessing techniques, feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs and mel spectrograms), hyperparameter tuning, and regularization strategies to improve performance. A comprehensive evaluation using 10-fold cross-validation was conducted, with results reported for accuracy and consistency.
